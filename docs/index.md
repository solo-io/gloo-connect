### What is Gloo Connect?

Gloo Connect is built on top of [Consul](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul) and [Gloo](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo) to enable real time route authorization and response configuration management. Gloo Connect leverages Consul's Level 3/4 TCP authentication and Gloo's Level 7 function routing to provide a complete secure, observable, and configurable service delivery environment.
