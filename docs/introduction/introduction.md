# Introduction

### What is QLoo?

QLoo is a GraphQL Server built on top of [Gloo](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo) and the [Envoy Proxy](https://envoyproxy.io).

QLoo leverages Gloo's function registry and Envoy's advanced HTTP routing features to provide a GraphQL frontend
for REST/gRPC applications and serverless functions. QLoo routes requests to data sources via Envoy, leveraging
Envoy [HTTP filters](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v2/config/filter/filter.html?highlight=http%20filter)
for security, load balancing, and more.

QLoo makes HTTP requests through Gloo to invoke service endpoints and serverless functions through Gloo. QLoo users
import their GraphQL Schemas and attach **Gloo functions** to the fields of their schemas. QLoo uses Gloo functions to generate
its own resolvers, allowing users to get a fully-functional GraphQL frontend for their serverless functions and services
without writing any code. This is why we call QLoo the **Codeless GraphQL Server**.

### Using QLoo

Compared to typical GraphQL implementations, QLoo's configuration API is quite simple. Configuration takes two steps:
